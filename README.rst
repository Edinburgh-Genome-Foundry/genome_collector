Genome Collector (full documentation
`here <https://edinburgh-genome-foundry.github.io/genome_collector/>`_)
is a Python library to download and manage reference genome data for specific
TaxIDs, in particular nucleotide and protein sequences (in fasta/genbank/gff
formats), and alignment databases (BLAST, Bowtie1/2).

The data is downloaded automatically on a need-to basis, making it very easy
for Python projects to use and re-use reference genomes of E. coli,
S. cerevisiae, and so on, without the worry of manually downloading from NCBI.

Examples
--------

Let's get Biopython records of all protein sequences in *E. coli*:

.. code:: python

    from genome_collector import GenomeCollection
    collection = GenomeCollection()
    records = collection.get_taxid_biopython_records(511145, "protein_fasta")

And that's it! If the protein data wasn't already on your machine, Genome
Collector downloaded from NCBI, and stored in your "collection" for the next
time time you need it.

Now let's get a path to a local BLAST database for *S. cerevisiae*:

.. code:: python

    from genome_collector import GenomeCollection
    collection = GenomeCollection()
    db_path = collection.get_taxid_blastdb_path(taxid=559292, db_type='nucl')

If there was no *S. cerevisiae* database on your machine, Genome Collector
downloaded the genome data and built it. It is now in your collection, and you
can use the returned ``db_path`` to start a BLAST process:

.. code:: python

    import subprocess
    process = subprocess.run([
        'blastn', '-db', db_path, '-query', 'queries.fa', '-out', 'results.txt'
    ])

Usage tips
----------

Changing the data storage directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can decide where a collection's local files will be stored with the
``data_dir`` parameter of ``GenomeCollection``. Note that the default value for
``data_dir`` is highly recommended as it always points to the same local user
data folder. As a consequence, all librairies and applications using the
default will be able to pick genomes from the same folder. The path of this
default ``collection.data_dir`` is platform-specific:

- ``~/.local/share/genome_collector`` on Linux
- ``~/Library/Application Support/genome_collector`` on MacOS
- ``C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Local Settings\EGF\genome_collector`` on Windows

You can set the local default path globally at the beginning of your Python
script with:

.. code:: python

    from genome_collector import GenomeCollection
    GenomeCollection.default_dir = '/my/new/dir'

Finally, you can set a default path as an environment variable (so it will be
shared by different Python processes):

.. code::

    env GENOME_COLLECTOR_DATA_DIR = /my/other/path



Preventing auto-download
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Genome Collector in a particular project, for instance a web app,
you may want to pre-download only a few genomes, and prevent users from using
other genomes. This can be done by setting a collection's ``autodownload``
attribute to False. To globally prevent Genome Collector from downloadind
data files, set this attribute at class level:

.. code:: python

    GenomeCollection.autodownload = False


Command line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The very basic command-line interface enables to use Genome Collector to
pre-download genomes and pre-build BLAST databases on a machine. This can
be particularly useful in Dockerfiles to set up docker containers.

.. code::

    python -m genome_collector genome 511145
    python -m genome_collector blast_db 511145 nucl


By default these genomes will be downloaded to the platform-specific local
data folder. This can be changed by adding a data_dir at the end:

.. code::

    python -m genome_collector genome 511145 /path/to/some/dir/


Similar projects
----------------

`ncbi-genome-download <https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download>`_
and `Genomepy <https://github.com/simonvh/genomepy>`_ are previous projects with
a similar goal. In comparison, Genome Collector is more opinionated, it uses
TaxID first, and is meant for use in Python scripts/Jupyter
notebooks (while the other tools are primarily for command-line usage), with
practical features like Biopython records loading and "on-demand"
genome downloading and database building.

Installation
-------------

You can install genome_collector through PIP

.. code::

    sudo pip install genome_collector

Alternatively, you can unzip the sources in a folder and type

.. code::

    sudo python setup.py install

For the BLAST-related features to work, you must have the NCBI BLAST software
installed. For instance on Ubuntu install with:

.. code::

    sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+
